# 7 Different Levels
### each of them dipicts some Real World Idle environment or Fictional Attributes
![Level Map](https://github.com/tanmaymodi/dont-blink/blob/main/db3.png)

For example:
# In Space Level:
### There is zero gravity. So, our player depicts real spaceship behaviour!🚀

# In Underwater Level:
### Buoyancy force acts on the player, angular drag also increases a little bit.🌊

- same with SNOW❄ level where friction is less, 
- sky, where gravity is less and air drag exits.

## In the same manner there are also some miscellaneous behaviour environment!!

#keeping all these this is mind you also have to give attension to game assets that you are passing by, beacause as you clear the level you will ve asked a question, about the things that have seen while playing the game, and there are high chances that you have ignored them...........so all the best for that!!

### This game is designed to simulate real world environment, focusing skills, memory power and how fast you adapt the change in conditions!!

##WIsh you great time ahead!!!👋
